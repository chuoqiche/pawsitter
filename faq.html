                    <p>PawSitter offers a wide range of activities for your pets to enjoy depending on their mood and personality. For adventurous and playful pets, they are able to have as much fun during their time here with fun toys and accessories. On the other hand, for pets that are less active and older, our DayCare facility provides comfy rest beds and mattresses for them to sleep and take a nap. Furthermore, our caregivers are certified and professionally trained to take good care of your precious pets. Most importantly, we put an overall importance on your pet’s mental and physical health. When they are playing with each other, accidents might happen. By that, if they are hurt in any way, we take full responsibility and accountability  to make sure your pets are treated properly without any additional or hidden fees.</p>
